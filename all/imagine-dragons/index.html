    <h1>Imagine Dragons</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Imagine Dragons</strong> is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist and keyboardist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure in 2012 with the releases of their debut studio album Night Visions and its first single "It's Time". Billboard placed them at the top of their "Year In Rock" rankings for 2013, and named them their "Breakthrough Band of 2013". Rolling Stone named their single "Radioactive" from Night Visions the "biggest rock hit of the year", and MTV called them "the year's biggest breakout band". Night Visions peaked at number two on the weekly US Billboard 200 chart and the UK Albums Chart. The band's second studio album Smoke + Mirrors was released in 2015, and reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. After touring for their sophomore record, the band took a brief hiatus to focus on their personal lives. During the latter half of 2016, they began recording their third studio album, Evolve, released in 2017. While all three albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Dragons"> - Wikipedia</a>
